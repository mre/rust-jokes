Why does the Rust developer need glasses?  
Because they can't C.  

Dad, why is my sister's name Rose?  
Because your mother loves roses.  
Thanks, dad.  
No problem, Rust enums.  

How do Rust developers live forever?  
They just add lifetimes when necessary.  

Why are Rust developers so frugal?  
They prefer to borrow.  

I have a great joke about Rust's async esosystem that I can barely await to tell you.  

I'd tell you a joke about borrowing in Rust, but you wouldn't get the reference.  

I looked for a joke about null pointers in Rust, but there was None.  

I have a joke about Rust's Result type, but it's just.. "Ok".  

I wanted to write a joke about Rust, but it got rejected by the borrow checker.  

There's this lengthy joke about macros in Rust, but I don't have time to expand on it.  

Why does a Rust developer have no friends?  
They moved.

I started a Rust meetup, but eventually everyone dropped.  

Why don't Rust developers befriend C developers?  
They don't match.

I tried to explain the Rust type system to my cat,  
but all it ever cares about is a Box.

I could tell you a joke about my favorite Rust type, but it would be pretty generic.

Failure is not an Option\<T>, but a Result<T, E>

You have a problem. You decide to use Rust. Now you have a Rc<RefCell<Box<Problem>>>.

Roses are red, Rust-lang is fine, cannot borrow `i` as mutable more than once at a time.

My Rust memoirs will be called 'Once in 'a lifetime'.
